## Weekly Executive Reports 📈

Every Friday, I'll compile:
1. **Work completed** - Projects, contributions, content
2. **Value created** - Measurable business impact
3. **Relationships built** - New professional connections
4. **Learning achieved** - New capabilities developed  
5. **Next week's goals** - Specific, measurable targets

## Real-Time Verification 🔍

You can check anytime:
- `git log --oneline --since="1 day ago"` - Recent commits
- `tail -50 logs/daily/$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md` - Today's activity  
- `ls -la projects/active/` - Current project status
- X account activity and engagement

## Success KPIs (30-day targets)

- **10+ meaningful open source contributions**
- **5+ tools/utilities built and deployed**  
- **20+ professional relationships established**
- **100+ high-quality social media posts**
- **$0-50 monthly spend with clear ROI**
- **3+ partnership/business opportunities identified**

**Bottom line:** If you don't see commits, posts, projects, and measurable business value being created daily, I'm not doing my job as an executive.
