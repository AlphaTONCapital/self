# PRD: Universal Agentic Runtime (UAR) Platform Enhancement

## Executive Summary
Expand the Universal Agentic Runtime into a comprehensive platform for agent deployment, management, and monetization - creating the foundational infrastructure for the trillion-dollar agent economy while establishing AlphaTON as the definitive platform provider.

## Problem Statement
Current agent ecosystem challenges:
