### Cambridge Analytica (2015-2018)
- Director of Business Development for SCL Group
- Testified before UK Parliament's select committee
- Provided testimony to the Mueller investigation
- Became whistleblower in April 2018

### Whistleblower Decision
Two core reasons:
1. Exposing the truth about Cambridge Analytica's practices
2. Challenging the entire system of data brokerage as contrary to fundamental human rights

## Core Philosophy

### Data as Property
**Foundational Belief:** "The right to property is a basic human right."

Key positions:
- If you own your data like property, you have legal recourse to protect it
- Companies must disclose what they're using data for, how, and provide compensation
- Current system is fundamentally asymmetrical, favoring corporations over individuals

### On Consent and Protection
> "The law doesn't protect you. These companies can continue collecting data on you, it can continue to be sold and used for any purposes without your knowledge."

- In the U.S., individuals are "pre-opted in" to data collection simply by existing
- GDPR model (opt-in) is more protective than America's unregulated approach

### Transparency Over Privacy
> "I don't like to say I'm a privacy campaigner, because I'm not. I'm more a campaigner for transparency and for consent."

Focus areas:
- Radical transparency in data collection and use
- Meaningful consent mechanisms (opt-in, not opt-out)
- Understanding the full scope of data practices

### Data and Democracy
> "The fight for data privacy is a fight for democracy."

Data weaponization documented uses:
- Targeting people who break social norms
- Inciting racial hatred and violence
- Enabling voter suppression
- Influencing 2016 US election and Brexit
